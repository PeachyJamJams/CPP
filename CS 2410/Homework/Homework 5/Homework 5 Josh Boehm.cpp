Program 5

For this program we are using objects, class, Inheritance, Polymorphism, and virtual function.   
(Programming Challenge 1 & #3 Page 982-Chapter 15  E9)
Design a class named Employee.  The class should keep the following information:

* Employee name
* Employee number
* Hire date

Write one or more constructors, and the appropriate  accessors and mutator functions, for the class.  
Next write a class named   ProductionWorker that is derived from   Employee class. 
The   ProductionWorker  class should have member variables to hold the following information:

* Shift (an integer)
* Hourly pay rate (a double)

The workday is divided into two shifts: day and night.  
The shift variable hold an integer value representing the shift that the employee works.  
The day shift is shift 1, and the night shift is shift 2.  
Write one or more constructors, and the appropriates accessor  and mutator functions, 
for the class by witting a program that uses a   ProductionWorker object
